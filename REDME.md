### About the Project

  

This project provides solutions to 45 programming problems, ranging from basic arithmetic to intermediate data structure operations. The solutions demonstrate:

  

Core Java Concepts: Variables, loops, conditionals, and methods. Data Structures: Usage of ArrayList, HashSet, and more. Input/Output: Robust input handling with Scanner and formatted output. Error Handling: Management of edge cases like invalid inputs or division by zero.
